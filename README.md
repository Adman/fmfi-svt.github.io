How it works
------------

- generated by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)
- hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/categories/github-pages-basics/), with a custom domain (see https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages/)
- data about projects and members are in `_data/projects.yml` and `_data/members.yml` respectively (for easier editing)
- "uses" tags are defined in `_data/uses_tags.yml`
